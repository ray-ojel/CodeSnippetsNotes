SAMPLING:
# Population: Set of ALL values in the dataset
# Sample: A smaller group selected from the population

# Sampling Error: Difference between the population and sample metrics
Sampling Error = parameter - statistic
# Parameter: A metric specific to a population
# Statistic: A metric speicific to a sample

# Simple random sampling (SRS)
Series.Sample(n) # Generate random numbers and use them to select a sample
#OR
DataFrame.Sample(n) # Method

# Stratified sampling
# Organize data into different groups, then SRS every group

# Cluster Sampling
# List all data sources, randomly pick only a few, then SRS every group

VARIABLES:
# Quantitative Variable
# Describes HOW MUCH THERE IS of something i.e quantitiy

# Qualitative or Categorical Variables
# Descibes the Qualities of the variable like color or name

# Scales of Measurment
# The system of rules that define how each variable is measured

# Nominal Scale
# Qualitative Data, Tell Difference, No Size of Diff, No Direction of Diff (No Ordering)

# Ordinal Scale
# Qualitative Data, Ranking, Tell Diff, Tell Direction (Ordering), No Size of Diff

# Interval Scale
# Quantitative Data, Tell Diff, Tell Direction (Ordering),but no true zero

# Ratio Scale
# Quantitative Data, Tell Diff, Tell Direction (Ordering), and True zero exists
# Can measure Diff using DISTANCE or RATIO i.e 2x heavier than or 1x lighter

# Discrete Variable
# No possible value in between any two adjacent values of the variable, ex No. ppl
